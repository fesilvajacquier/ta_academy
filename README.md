# TA academy

## Intent

* The goal is to expose students to every day situations they'll face as TAs and to provide tools on how to handle them.
* There is no evaluation from the facilitators' side.
* The evaluation should come from themselves. If they feel that an activity is too hard it means that they have to work on that to avoid unnecessary struggles while _TAing_
* The common theme across all activities is **communication**. Someone can be a good TA without much technical expertise, but no one can be a decent TA if he/she does not communicate clearly.

## Students' preparation

Students are expected to:

* Be on time
* Be ready having:
  * IDE / text editor open
  * Pen & paper
* Be participative

## Facilitator's preparation

* Clone this repo.
* Create a `tmp` directory to copy & paste exercise templates.

## Structure

* 4 weekly meetings
* 1 hour each
* Participants: 2 - 6
* Each meeting will have 2 main blocks
  * **Homework** presentation & feedback. In the first meeting this block is replaced by **Introduction**
  * **Day activity** execution

### Meeting 1

## Activities

### Command line workout

üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The facilitator will act as bootcamp student sharing his/her screen and presenting students with git, bash & config related issues.
Students will take turns to solve these issues.
If a student cannot solve the issue he/she has been assigned, the facilitator should ask all students to collaborate.

Further details & activity's material can be found [here](./activities/activities_material.md#command-line-workout)

### Design a feature

üìê

The facilitator will act as bootcamp student sharing his/her screen and presenting students with features to design.
Students will take turns to elaborate on how they would tackle these features. The student's participation is considered completed when he/she provided the pseudocoding covering all the steps to develop the assigned feature.
If a student cannot provide a proper answer, the facilitator should ask all students to collaborate.

### Dictate a method

üó£

Students will take turns to dictate the provided method to peers.
Peers can ask 1 (or should it be 2? 3?) question for clarification.
At the end of the student's turn he/she will share his/her screen to display the dictated method. Peers will be able to see how far off their attempts were and feedback will be given to the student.
