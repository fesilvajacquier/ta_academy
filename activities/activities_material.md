# Activities material

## Command line workout

The facilitator should pay attention to:

* Students base knowledge of this topics
* Students strategy to look for insights in how to solve the issue. For example, does he/she searches for official documentation as a first option?
* Students ability to narrate their research process as it takes place.

## Design a feature

The facilitator should pay attention to:

* Students anticipating pain points that bootcamp students are going to face when following the provided pseudocode. For example, if the solution involves an AR query or callback the student should say something like `When going through step 2 you might need to use "X", if so, dedicate a couple of minutes to read the docs.`

## Refactoring

Activity material is found at `refactoring.rb`. This is the file meant to be used during the workshop.

Facilitators material is found at `refactoring_facilitator.rb`. This file contains material for the facilitators preparation containing the expected outcome for each challenge explicitly declaring the key concepts to point out.

## Solve tickets from slack

Students should share their experiences having focus on:

* Was the original question well formulated? Why? Why not?
* Clarification questions were required? If so, how were they formulated?
* Additional research was required to give a complete answer? Which were the sources?
* Was your answer clear? What was the feedback from the OP?

The facilitator feedback should highlight that:

* Usually questions are poorly formulated or do not have enough context
* As it should be done when debugging, when trying to provide a solution for a problem assumptions should be validated or discarded.

## Write an article

The facilitator feedback should highlight that:

* Writing a technical article resembles the process of providing guidance to a student. When writing an article the communication flows one way because there is no possible interaction and when guiding a student what impedes the interaction is his/hers technical knowledge. Therefore, the same thoroughness and clarity is required.
