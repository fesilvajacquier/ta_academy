# As an user I can search for "elements" having autocomplete options displayed so that I can find things quickly

# As a user can tune an order so that I can purchase exactly what I want.
#    For this example we can imagine that we have:
#      The model `Order`
#      An `order` has many `order_items`
#      An `order_item` belongs to a `product`

#    When creating an order the user should be able to add as many order items as he/she wants.
#    Each time a new item is added the total price should be updated

# As an owner I can accept an offer (rejecting all others) so that I can sell in the most convenient way

# As a user I can select an available time slot so that I can schedule my doctor's appointment

# As a visitor I can proceed up to de last step of the checkout without logging in
